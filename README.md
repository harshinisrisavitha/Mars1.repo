# Mars recruitment task 1

1)linux commands->
The terminal in windows was used to execute the commands.The commands which I have used were 
cd
mkdir
ls
cat
echo
mv
rm
I have used the first command to change the directory from the current one to the desktop.Then I made a directory named test1.In that directory I created 3 text files named file1,file2,file3.I used the echo command to print a line in each of the text files.Then I have used the cat command to print the content in each of the text files.I used "cat f*>combine.txt" to combie all the text file starting with the letter f in the directory into a new text file named combine.then i printed the content in it.Then I changed the directory to the user.Then I have changed it to Desktop and created another directory in it named test2.Further i changed it back to test1 and moved file1 into test2 and have deleted the other text files i.e file2,file3.on execution in my laptop i got the following.

2)bash script->    
The ubuntu terminal was used to execute the commands.Initially Ihave created a bash file using the command "nano filename.sh".Next I used the command "sudo chmond +x filename.sh ",this requires me to use my password .Then i was able to execute the bash file using the comand "./filename.sh".I have used the echo command to print a text line and used the "fine .|grep txt " to list all the files in that directory with the txt extension.Then I have used the mkdir to creaste the new directiory.Later i used the co command to copy all the listed files to the newely created directory.On executing it my laptop I got hte following output.

3)prime factors->
Vscode was used to tye the code and execute it.I have used 2 functions namely "factor","prime".The factor function takes an integer input and checks all the factors of that integer.It calls upon the prime function to check whether the obtained factor is a prime factor or not. If it is a prime factor then we increment the k integer and if k=4 i.e there are 4 distinct prime factors for that number then we go back to the main function to check whether the consecutive 3 numbers also satisfy the condition.If they do then the program prints all consecutive 4 integers and breas from the loop.
